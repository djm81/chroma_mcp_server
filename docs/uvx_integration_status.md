# Chroma MCP Server UVX Integration Status

This document summarizes our efforts to prepare the Chroma MCP Server to be run with UVX and to build a distributable package.

## Approaches Tested

### 1. Local PyPI Index Approach

**Initial Strategy**:

- Build the package as a wheel using `pip wheel`
- Create a local PyPI index structure
- Use UVX to run the package from this local index

**Scripts Created**:

- `run_chroma_mcp_uvx.py`: Script to build the wheel, create a local index, and run via UVX

**Issues Encountered**:

- Package naming conventions: Wheel built as `chroma_mcp_server-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (underscores) but UVX looks for `chroma-mcp-server` (hyphens)
- UVX could not find the package despite creating proper index structure
- Hash format in index.html file caused issues with UVX's package detection
- Dependency resolution issues when UVX tried to install the package

**Modifications Made**:

- Updated index structure to copy wheel files with both naming conventions
- Changed hash format in index.html to use `sha256=` prefix
- Created sample configuration for `.cursor/mcp.json`

### 2. Direct Installation Approach

**Strategy**:

- Install the package directly in development mode
- Modify dependency structure in `pyproject.toml`
- Run server module directly

**Scripts Created**:

- `run_chromamcp_local.py`: Creates a dedicated virtual environment, installs the package with proper dependencies, and runs the server

**Improvements**:

- Added `chromadb>=0.6.3` and `fastmcp>=0.4.1` to the dev dependencies
- Created a more flexible dependency structure in `pyproject.toml`
- Added graceful fallback for missing optional dependencies in the server

### 3. UVX Direct Integration

**Strategy**:

- Register the package with UVX by installing it in development mode
- Add proper entry points in `pyproject.toml`
- Use UVX to run the installed package

**Scripts Created**:

- `run_with_uvx.py`: Creates a dedicated virtual environment for UVX, installs the package, and runs it via UVX
- `setup_for_uvx.py`: Installs the package in development mode and verifies UVX can find it

**Issues**:

- UVX still cannot find the locally installed package
- Entry points properly configured but not detected by UVX

## Current Status

### Working Solutions

✅ **Local Development**: The `run_chromamcp_local.py` script successfully:

- Creates a dedicated virtual environment
- Installs the package with dev dependencies
- Runs the server directly
- Gracefully handles missing optional dependencies

✅ **Package Structure**: The package is now properly organized with:

- Core dependencies in the main `dependencies` section
- Full dependencies in the `[full]` extras
- Development dependencies in the `[dev]` extras
- Entry points defined for command line and UVX usage

❌ **UVX Integration**: Not fully working:

- UVX cannot find the locally installed package despite proper configuration
- Local PyPI index approach has issues with dependency resolution
- Direct UVX integration fails to find the installed package

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Use the Local Development Approach**:
   - For now, `run_chromamcp_local.py` provides a stable way to run the server for development
   - This approach ensures all dependencies are properly managed in a dedicated environment

2. **For MCP Integration**:
   - Install the package system-wide or in the MCP's environment
   - Use the direct module import pattern: `python -m chroma_mcp.server`
   - Configure necessary environment variables in `.cursor/mcp.json`

3. **Future UVX Improvements**:
   - Investigate UVX's package discovery mechanism for local packages
   - Consider packaging and publishing to PyPI or a private repository
   - Explore alternative approaches like `pipx` for isolated execution

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update README.md to include installation and usage instructions
   - Document available server configuration options
   - Add examples for integrating with Cursor MCP

## Configuration Template

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "chroma_mcp_server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "chroma_mcp.server",
        "--data-dir", "data",
        "--log-dir", "logs"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "PYTHONIOENCODING": "utf-8"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Summary

While UVX integration is not yet fully working, we have a robust local development setup that can be used for both development and for MCP integration. The package structure is now properly organized with sensible dependency groups, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
